Explanations of the technologies used-
	Phaser framework, meteor for database

A couple paragraphs about the general approach you took
	I wanted to create a game, and learn new frameworks. First was researching new technologies. Phaser and meteor was recommended to me. After reading docs, I agreed. I knew I wanted to make a 2d side scroller game. I then drew up the wireframes, and started to code. Then I had to learn about sprites and created my own. A lot of time was spent on non-coding, creating and making image and audio files. As the project grew the game evolved and changed. Learning more about the phaser allowed me to add more features. This had me exploring more than I should and distracted me from the game. My research was for my game, but it took away from me actually making the game. Including backend is what I saved for last and meteor was new to me. It was easier than I thought it would be. Also with meteor it let me deploy my game and they even host. (It was easy and one line in my terminal)

Installation instructions for any dependencies
	> meteor (runs on localhost:3000)

Link to your user stories – who are your users, what do they want, and why?
	As a user I want to interact with a character in a game and have them be able to jump and avoid enimies.
	As a user I want to log my score and name when I am finished.

Descriptions of any unsolved problems or major hurdles you had to overcome
	Merging meteor after my phaser game was started. Having to rename functions, move files and folders.
